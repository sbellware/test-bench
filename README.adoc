Test Bench
==========

TestBench is a no-nonsense testing framework for Ruby aiming to offer precisely what is needed to test well-designed code effectively and easily. In stark contrast to most other testing frameworks, test files are written using a procedural API, not a declarative one, which brings a score of substantial benefits in exchange for largely immaterial drawbacks. As a result, TestBench can be learned very quickly. However, users should not expect it to offer many palliative features that ease the difficulties inherent to working with vast, long-running, or brittle test suites. With that in mind, even those situations can usually be addressed with a little improvising.

Quick Start Guide
-----------------

To install TestBench with Rubygems:

[source]
----
> gem install test_bench
----

Or, to add it to a project's +Gemfile+ if using Bundler:

[source]
----
gem 'test_bench'
----

Next, write a test loader, e.g. +test/test_init.rb+:

[source,ruby]
----
# Begin test/test_init.rb

# Load the code to be tested
require_relative '../lib/my/code.rb'

# Load Test Bench and then activate it
require 'test_bench'; TestBench.activate

# End test/test_init.rb
----

Then add test files that require the test loader via +require_relative+. The typical directory to store test files is +test/automated+. For example:

[source,ruby]
----
# Begin test/automated/example.rb

require_relative './automated_init'

context "Example Context" do
  test "Pass" do
    assert(true)
  end

  test "Assertion failure" do
    assert(false)
  end

  test "Error" do
    fail "Some error"
  end
end

# End test/automated/example.rb
----

The above test file can be run directly by ruby:

image::/doc/images/run-single-test-file.png[Run Single Test File With Ruby]

To run all the tests within e.g. the +test/automated+ directory, the TestBench runner can be used. Invoke the runner from a script within the project (commonly +test/automated.rb+):

[source,ruby]
----
# Begin test/automated.rb

require_relative './test_init'

TestBench::Run.('test/automated')

# End test/automated.rb
----

Now invoke the runner:

image::/doc/images/run-all-test-files.png[Run All Test Files With Runner]

After that, the project should be up and running.

2.1.1 - Thu Dec 19 2019
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Test files and subdirectories found within directories are sorted by the CLI before being loaded.

2.1.0 - Wed Oct 17 2019
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* The CLI accepts all of the settings as keyword arguments. Settings supplied to the CLI in this manner will be displayed as the default values by the CLI help text. This allows the CLI settings to be customized on a per-project basis, similar to a per-project configuration file.
* The CLI::Run class accepts the +exclude_file_pattern+ setting as a keyword argument.
* The output methods +enter_assert_block+ and +exit_assert_block+ are now supplied the caller location of the corresponding assertion.
* A bug was fixed in the output implementation that would fail to print outer assertion failures from a block-form assert when the abort on error setting is active.

2.0.0 - Tue Oct 15 2019
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The changes from TestBench 1 are too numerous to enumerate. See link:/doc/Changes-From-TestBench-1-To-TestBench-2.adoc[Changes From TestBench 1 To TestBench 2] for an overview of the most significant changes.
